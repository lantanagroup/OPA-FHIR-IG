This guide is dependent on US Core FHIR IG and as such uses the following profiles published in US Core:
* Practitioner (DE#2)
* Vital Signs (Observations) (DE#24, 25, 26, and 27)
* Smoking Status Observation (DE#28)
* Pregnancy Status Observation (DE#15)
* Pregnancy Intent Observation (DE#16)
* Sexual Orientation Observation (DE#42)

Data falling into resources listed above are expected to conform to their appropriate US Core profile and should be included in a Bunlde from a TitleX grantee and sent to OPA.

Further, this guide defines the following profiles based on US Core profiles. Implementers of US Core and this guide should use the appropriate existing US Core profiles as the base definition for these OPA profiles:
* OPA Family Planning Provider Organization (DE#1)
* OPA Patient (DE#4, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10)
* OPA PractitionerRole (DE#3)
* OPA Encounter (DE#5)
